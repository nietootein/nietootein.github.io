I am an Associate Professor of Physics at Universidad Complutense de Madrid ([UCM](https://www.ucm.es)), where I teach and do research in high-energy astrophysics. I am also a member of the Institute of Particle and Cosmos Physics ([IPARCOS](https://www.ucm.es/iparcos/)) and the High Energy Group ([GAE](https://gaeweb.hst.ucm.es/)) at UCM.
