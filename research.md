My research focuses on experimental high-energy astrophysics. I have been given the opportunity to work on one of the most fascinating  open problems in Physics, namely, the search for the constituent of the dark matter, and have faced that challenge from multiple and complementary fronts: I have scrutinized data from X-ray and gamma-ray space telescopes, as well as ground-based gamma-ray and optical telescopes searching for indirect signals of the presence of dark matter; I have operated cutting-edge international research facilities gathering data for such searches; I have contributed to the development of novel instrumentation through extensive simulations and also hardware design, production, testing and verification;  I have developed and implemented new deep-learning based analysis techniques to enhance the sensitivity of ground-based gamma-ray telescopes. And all these, fortunately surrounded by world-class scientist working together in international research collaborations, managing small teams of brilliant young scientists, and coordinating international research teams in topics ranging from simulations to machine learning. Besides, I have been principal investigator of NASA and ERDF EU-funded projects.
